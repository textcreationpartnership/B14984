            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Euer ≈øince the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> beganne to repine at <hi>Bauariaes</hi> intru≈øion into the honour of the≈øe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Emperour ≈øeemed partially affected to his ≈øeruice, many Princes mi≈øliked the ≈øame, and by way of commi≈øeration thought it too much, that the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> ≈øhould be vtterly ouerthrowne; and therefore, as you haue participated out of diuers Di≈øcour≈øes, they haue recollected them≈øelues, and thus proceeded toward his reliefe and ≈øupportation: whereas it hath beene fir≈øt generally reported, that <hi>Hungaria</hi> is reduced to the Emperours iuri≈ødiction, and that a League of Amitie hath beene contracted betweene him, and <hi>Bethelem Gabor;</hi> there is no ≈øuch matter, but rather the contrary. For the Prince of <hi>Tran≈øiluania</hi> calling the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> Go≈ø≈øip, by rea≈øon he had chri≈øtned him a childe; hath prote≈øted neuer to for≈øake him, till he ≈øee him one way or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other re-e≈øtabli≈øhed: Indeed I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe he hath ab≈øtained from crowning him≈øelfe king of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> vpon a certaine vow, he would neuer be inue≈øted, till the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> garri≈øons and Emperors forces were put out of Rub, <hi>Camora</hi> &amp; other places: yea till <hi>Pre≈øhurgh</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, the repinings of <hi>Prague,</hi> and ≈øome other townes, which are ≈øtill vnder the King of <hi>Bohemiaes</hi> protection haue bene greater again≈øt the Emperour and his forces of late dayes, then euer before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> ≈øcarce named in other Relations, hauing mu≈øtered ≈øome forces for the defence of his Countrey, and commaunded by the Emperour to vnite them to <hi>Bauaria,</hi> hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered plainely, That as they are mu≈øtered by the aduice of his Coun≈øell and Lords, they are likewi≈øe to be di≈øpo≈øed by them, who neuer had occa≈øion of vnkindnes with the <hi>Palatine,</hi> and therefore will not now beginne.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Princes of the Vnion perceiuing what a fearefull thing it is to let an enemy ≈øet footing in an others Countrey, e≈øpecially to fortifie him≈øelfe, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath done in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> are generall repiners at their owne fir≈øt ≈ølackene≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo re≈øolue to recouer their much di≈øtre≈ø≈øed honours by ≈øome new and glorious attempts in behalfe of their friend and confederate.</p>

            <p>Seuenthly, the Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicke</hi> comming but fir≈øt into the Low countries, to ≈øalute the Queene of <hi>Bohemia</hi> at the <hi>Hage,</hi> offered them his ≈øeruice, and was not onely accepted, but ≈øupplied with men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the <hi>Sluces,</hi> and ≈øo went directly into <hi>We≈øtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and by degrees like a ball of ≈ønow waxed bigger and bigger, &amp; increa≈øed his forces, ≈øo that he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Dioces of <hi>Cullen,</hi> &amp; proceeded in many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioue actions which you haue heard of, and which haue indeed made him renowned ouer the world.</p>

            <p>The≈øe things are in the general thus ≈øet downe to ≈øhew you the cau≈øe, why the Emperor without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouer≈øie is weary of the warre, and ≈øu≈øpects that his friends wil neuer be able to with≈øtand ≈øo great forces &amp; men exa≈øperated euery where again≈øt him, not ≈øo much for his owne cau≈øe, and great ≈øpirit in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his honour &amp; renowne, as hearkening to the <hi>Sirens</hi> ≈øongs of the Ie≈øuites, who in trueth care ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him, nor any Prince what≈øoeuer, nor for the ≈ølaughter of the people, di≈øturbance of their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

            <p>I will now go forward to the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe in hand, which depends on the actions of the Duke of <hi>Brun≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who haue beene in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent imployment, euen ≈øince the Emperors Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øadour went into <hi>England,</hi> and mo≈øt wonderfully ≈øet forward the King of <hi>Bohemiaes</hi> affaires, ≈øo that as far as men may be confident of worldly computation, ther is great hope of recouery, &amp; turning of fortunes wheele, that he may be brought at la≈øt to the toppe, which hath ≈øo long beene kept with his head downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: ≈øo that to make the matter more per≈øpicuous, I mu≈øt ≈øay with the Poet; <hi>arma viro≈øqne cuno,</hi> and tell you fir≈øt, what the Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicke</hi> hath done, &amp; next, how Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> hath proceeded.</p>

            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicke</hi> heard of this, he forthwith be≈øtirred him≈øelfe, and ≈øet his actions on their be≈øt feete, that hee might be ready to attend the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> where≈øoeuer hee went; and thus he preuailed in many ≈øeuerall encounters tooke

For be≈øides the <hi>Carbines</hi> that charged mo≈øt violently, the Battalion was flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Musketeers, who powred their ≈øhot into <hi>Brun≈øwickes</hi> battailes, and had the fortune to kill ≈øome of his men.

            <p>This was a hard beginning, and put the ≈øouldiers in a ≈øhrewd feare: For a whole Cornet of hor≈øe was ≈øhiuered, and <hi>Brun≈øwicke</hi> lay for the time vnder foot, but it la≈øted not long: for his youth and courage got the victory of a≈øtoni≈øhment, and vp he gets, and vp he mounts againe, fir≈øt cau≈øing the Captaines to to fill vp the roome with a body of pikes, who kept the enemies hor≈øe from comming too forward: then did he charge them with fre≈øh hor≈øe, and ere they could wheele about to bring their pi≈øtols bulleted he put them all to rowt, and ≈øo was quittance with them for their fir≈øt branery: but taking another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of pikes, and finding the enemies Battalion ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

            <p>But vp hee gets againe, and vp hee mounts with courage and alacrity, and with that fury that hee ouerpre≈ø≈øed his enemies, and gaue ≈øuch example and encouragement to his Captaines, and ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that in all the good Di≈øcipline of a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh) I cannot call it a battaile, becau≈øe the main battailes neuer came to fight) they ≈øeconded one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that the ≈øhot kild three hundred, at three vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and the pikes trooped, as it were, to make the more ha≈øt to re≈øcue their braue Generall, who thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated, ≈øet tho≈øe hor≈øe on worke that were neere≈øt and when the enemy began to ≈øhake, he pre≈ø≈øed them ≈øo violently, that many fell vnder his ≈øword, and by computation, this skirmi≈øh continued foure long houres, and ≈øurely had continued longer, if a braue <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Captaine newly come out of <hi>Gulicke,</hi> had not brought vp certaine Hargubu≈øh on hor≈øebacke, and vnlookt for powred many ≈øhots into the pikes, which were ready to mingle with the Colonen≈øes, and at appoynt to end the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, whereat the Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicke</hi> enraged came ≈øo audaciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a Bullet grazed on his ≈øhoulder, and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177449:9"/>winde of many Bullets made him fall once againe from his hor≈øe, in≈øo much that a <hi>Wallon</hi> Captaine (as it was reported) ≈øtepped vnto him, ≈øuppo≈øing to take him pri≈øoner, but as he was lame in body, his bu≈øine≈ø≈øe ≈øucceeded as lamely: for to preuent the mi≈øchiefe, one <hi>Remigius</hi> a <hi>Dane</hi> oppo≈øed the lame Captaine, and in the ≈øight of the armies ≈ølue him outright, hauing thereby time to fetch vp <hi>Brun≈øwicks</hi> hor≈øe, and comfort to ≈øee him a liue, and vnhurt.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Concerning the Earle of <hi>Mansfield</hi> and his ≈øtrong Army, many remarkable things are written, which as briefly as I can I will ≈øuccinctly abreuiate into the≈øe heads. 1. Fir≈øt, that vnder≈øtanding, that all the Catholick Bi≈øhops were fled, hee gari≈øoned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177449:10"/>mo≈øt of Army in their ≈øtrong holds, and quartred them in the Villages, whereby as they ≈øay in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they had Mini≈øtrels fare, meate, drinke, and money. 2. Secondly, that when he perceiued his Army to encrea≈øe, and now to be ≈øo ≈øtrong, that the Monarchs of <hi>Europe</hi> looke vpon him with repining eyes, as wondering to what purpo≈øe he taketh ≈øuch large ≈øteps ouer the Catholick Countries, he made a defence or Apologie, diuulging it in the French tongue, and deliuered the Po≈øt of <hi>England, Balam</hi> by name, one of them to carie ouer with him. 3. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that vnder≈øtanding of the Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicks</hi> conflicts, hee writ Letters of gratification, and not onely applauded his actions, but reque≈øted a certificate from his owne hands, who returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere, how he had preuailed in many skirmi≈øhes: burnt <hi>We≈øterkotton, Erquetts, Amruth,</hi> one of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecks, Ruden, Vberhagen,</hi> and the <hi>Dio≈øarts</hi> hou≈øe of <hi>Werdell</hi> come from <hi>Lip≈øtat,</hi> wherein hee had like to haue beene betrayed with 25. Cornets of Horie, 6000. Foot, diuers Peeces of Ordnance, Fireworks, ≈øcaling Ladders, and many Pyoners: vpon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigne of importance out, he ≈øuddenly heard of the approach of the Bi≈øhops forces, and ≈øo was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ≈øtay and augment his Army, for a more fiercer encounter: and that he had taken ≈øome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, and ≈øome Friers, who were ≈øo ob≈øtinate, that they cryed out vpon nothing but trea≈øon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. 4. Fourthly, that while hee was at <hi>Germe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhem,</hi> and retired to many places with his maine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, Sir <hi>Horace Vere</hi> writing for ≈øome ≈øupplies, hee

            <p n="5">5.
